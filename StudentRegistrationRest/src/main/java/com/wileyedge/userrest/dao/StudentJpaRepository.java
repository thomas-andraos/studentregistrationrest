/*
The idea is that you 
create interface method signatures in a specific format that the system can interpret and 
convert to SQL queries behind the scenes.

These method names always start with findBy, followed by the filters we want to apply 
to the query

eg List<Store> findByManager(String manager); internally is converted to
SELECT * FROM store WHERE manager = ?

The question mark will be filled in by the parameter of the method.


findById 	: Retrieves one object based on the ID you pass it
findAll  	: Retrieves a list of all the objects of the type
save  		: Used for both creating and updating an object; returns the object that was created or updated as it now exists in the database
deleteById : Deletes the object with the passed ID from the database
count 		: Retrieves a count of all objects of a type in the database
existsById : Checks if an object with the passed ID exists in the database; returns true or false
